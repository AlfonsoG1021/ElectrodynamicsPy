# ElectrodynamicsPy


My goal is to write logical, clear code which can either help me calculate or visualise the various physical quantities that arise from the study of electrodynamical systems.

## What I have implemented so far:

1. Calculate the field resulting from any point charges in 2D, with a stream plot.
2. Calculate the potential of point charges in 2D, with a contour plot.
3. Visualising the field and potential from charge distributions in 2D.
