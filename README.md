# ElectrodynamicsPy

My goal is to write logical, clear code which can either help me calculate or visualise the various physical quantities that arise
from the study of electrodynamical systems. 

## What I have implemented so far:

1. Code which calculates the field for any 2D arrangement of point charges, with an option to make a quick visualisation.
