# ElectrodynamicsPy

My goal is to write logical, clear code which can either calculate or visualise the various physical quantities that
 arise from the study of electrodynamical systems.

Have a look at the `examples` jupyter notebook to see what kind of stuff one can do with the code.

## What I have implemented so far:

1. Calculate the field resulting from any point charges in 2D, with a stream plot.
2. Calculate the potential of point charges in 2D, with a contour plot.
3. Visualising the field and potential from charge distributions in 2D.
4. Some (very amateurish) stuff regarding Legendre polynomials.
